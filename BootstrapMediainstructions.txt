Add in some glyph icons, can be used as links or buttons as well
Here are some other cool ideas:

1. wells (adds in a box)
2. rounded images, as well as responsive images
3. different types of text (danger warning info (also applies to the backgrounds))
4. Adds in consistency across the page
5. cool menus (such as drop down) (35:00)
6. How to group inputs together (40:00) Add in bootstrap theme as well
7. Radio and checkboxes (42:00) Good for MC pratice, https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_forms_inputs.asp
